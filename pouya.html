</p>
<p>
    Definitions of artificial intelligence according to eight recent textbooks are shown in the table below. These definitions vary along two main dimensions.
    The ones on top are concerned with <em>thought processes</em> and <em>reasoning</em>, whereas the ones on the bottom address <em>behavior</em>. Also, the
    definitions on the left measure success in terms of <em>human</em> performance, whereas the ones on the right measure against an <em>ideal</em> concept of
    intelligence, which we will call rationality. A system is rational if it does the right thing.

    Historically, all four approaches have been followed. As one might expect, a tension exists between approaches centered around humans and approaches
    centered around rationality. (We should point out that by distinguishing between human and rational behavior, we are not suggesting that humans are
    necessarily ``irrational'' in the sense of ``emotionally unstable'' or ``insane.'' One merely need note that we often make mistakes; we are not all chess
    grandmasters even though we may know all the rules of chess; and unfortunately, not everyone gets an A on the exam. Some systematic errors in human
    reasoning are cataloged by Kahneman <em>et al.</em>.) A human-centered approach must be an empirical science, involving hypothesis and experimental
    confirmation. A rationalist approach involves a combination of mathematics and engineering. People in each group sometimes cast aspersions on work done in
    the other groups, but the truth is that each direction has yielded valuable insights. Let us look at each in more detail.

    <strong>
        Ant Colony Optimization
        <p>
        </p>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    The ant colony algorithm is an algorithm for finding optimal paths that is based on the behavior of ants searching for food.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    At first, the ants wander randomly. When an ant finds a source of food, it walks back to the colony leaving "markers" (pheromones) that show the path has
    food. When other ants come across the markers, they are likely to follow the path with a certain probability. If they do, they then populate the path with
    their own markers as they bring the food back. As more ants find the path, it gets stronger until there are a couple streams of ants traveling to various
    food sources near the colony.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Because the ants drop pheromones every time they bring food, shorter paths are more likely to be stronger, hence optimizing the "solution." In the
meantime, some ants are still randomly scouting for closer food sources. A similar approach can be used find near-optimal solution to the    <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/TravelingSalesmanProblem.html">traveling salesman problem</a>.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Once the food source is depleted, the route is no longer populated with pheromones and slowly decays.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Because the ant-colony works on a very dynamic system, the ant colony algorithm works very well in graphs with changing topologies. Examples of such
    systems include computer networks, and artificial intelligence simulations of workers.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    1. The first ant wanders randomly until it finds the food source (F), then it returns to the nest (N), laying a pheromone trail.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    2. Other ants follow one of the paths at random, also laying pheromone trails. Since the ants on the shortest path lay pheromone trails faster, this path
    gets reinforced with more pheromone, making it more appealing to future ants.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    3. The ants become increasingly likely to follow the shortest path since it is constantly reinforced with a larger amount of pheromones. The pheromone
    trails of the longer paths evaporate.

<h1>
    AI, Robotics, and the Future of Jobs
    <p>
    </p>
</h1>
<p>
    The vast majority of respondents to the 2014 Future of the Internet canvassing anticipate that robotics and artificial intelligence will permeate wide
    segments of daily life by 2025, with huge implications for a range of industries such as health care, transport and logistics, customer service, and home
    maintenance. But even as they are largely consistent in their predictions for the evolution of technology itself, they are deeply divided on how advances
    in AI and robotics will impact the economic and employment picture over the next decade.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    We call this a canvassing because it is not a representative, randomized survey. Its findings emerge from an “opt in” invitation to experts who have been
    identified by researching those who are widely quoted as technology builders and analysts and those who have made insightful predictions to our previous
    queries about the future of the Internet. (For more details, please see the section “About this Report and Survey.”)
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Some 1,896 experts responded to the following question:
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>The economic impact of robotic advances and AI<em>—</em></strong>
    Self-driving cars, intelligent digital agents that can act for you, and robots are advancing rapidly. Will networked, automated, artificial intelligence
    (AI) applications and robotic devices have displaced more jobs than they have created by 2025?
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Half of these experts (48%) envision a future in which robots and digital agents have displaced significant numbers of both blue- and white-collar
    workers—with many expressing concern that this will lead to vast increases in income inequality, masses of people who are effectively unemployable, and
    breakdowns in the social order.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The other half of the experts who responded to this survey (52%) expect that technology will <em>not</em> displace more jobs than it creates by 2025. To be
    sure, this group anticipates that many jobs currently performed by humans will be substantially taken over by robots or digital agents by 2025. But they
    have faith that human ingenuity will create new jobs, industries, and ways to make a living, just as it has been doing since the dawn of the Industrial
    Revolution.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    These two groups also share certain hopes and concerns about the impact of technology on employment. For instance, many are concerned that our existing
    social structures—and especially our educational institutions—are not adequately preparing people for the skills that will be needed in the job market of
    the future. Conversely, others have hope that the coming changes will be an opportunity to reassess our society’s relationship to employment itself—by
    returning to a focus on small-scale or artisanal modes of production, or by giving people more time to spend on leisure, self-improvement, or time with
    loved ones.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    A number of themes ran through the responses to this question: those that are unique to either group, and those that were mentioned by members of both
    groups.

<h3>
    <strong>5 Popular Artificial Intelligence Careers</strong>
    <p>
    </p>
</h3>
<p>
    The career options available to the well-educated student are many and varied. Everybody loves video games, but newer games require highly intelligent
    enemies to keep players challenged. This is where a <strong>game programmer</strong>, or software engineer, comes in to play. With the right company, this
    job starts at $75,000 annually and reaching as high as $125,000 annually for lead programmers.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
Perhaps a more serious career is what you have in mind. Robots are taking over the industrial world, but they need programmers. A    <strong>robotic scientist</strong> or programmer makes a median salary of $90,000 annually. Robotic Scientists have the best shot at getting hired if they
    have at least a master’s in robotic engineering and receive licensing from their state.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    If you seek a career that helps out other humans, consider a career as a software engineer working on <strong>face recognition software</strong>. Many
    companies, including security companies, police departments, casinos, and even Google are utilizing face recognition to understand the people benefiting
    from their service. People seeking out this career choice have a wide range of salaries to choose from depending on their education level, from $28,000 to
    $125,000 annually.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Google will be one of the highest paying companies from face recognition, but they also use A.I. in another interesting way. Google hires people with
    artificial intelligence degrees to manage their massive <strong>search engine</strong>. The Google Search needs to be able to predict what users wish to
    search for despite spelling errors and thousands of possibilities of their intended meaning for the searched phrase. This is where A.I. becomes important.
    A Ph.D. can net you a salary upwards of $112,000 annually. Some of their highest paid senior software engineers take home over $250,000.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Often working for private companies can be a very difficult affair. Their hiring process is quite competitive and they seek out only the best of the best.
    However, the <strong>government</strong>employs the largest number of people in the nation and they too require the aid of highly skill artificial
    intelligence employees. Warfare is growing more complex by the day and thus the government is developing smart weapons. Their software development
    engineers earn a median salary of $73,000 annually, but the earnings also come with excellent benefits and retirement packages.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Artificial intelligence plays an increasingly large role in running the world around us and the possibilities for its use continue to grow. Any student
    willing to put in the effort to gain a high level of education will be quickly accepted into this growing and well paying industry.
