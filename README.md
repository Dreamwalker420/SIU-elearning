## Making Career Decisions: The Adventure of a Lifetime

With the expansion of the field of Computer Science, several unique concentrations have evolved at Southern Illinois University.  As such, a new student may not be unique familiar with these terms and the fields that they cover.  We intend to build a light interactive environment to easily explore and identify with these concentration concepts in a fully-enclosed module.  Enable students to make informed decisions about which concentration best suits their career goals will better serve the community.

## Learning Goal

* Educational path to the Concentration and the Career path afterwards.

## Learning Outcomes

* Improve clarity of concentration with brief awareness.
* Isolate user paths for choosing a concentration.
* Prevent negative outcomes from lack of knowledge.
* Simplified view of concentrations in abstract and objective form.
* Explain some algorithm with animation to better understanding 
* Show animal's life and how we can use of their technic in our technology
* Introduce the base of artificial intelligence 

## Learning Objectives

* Demonstrate course requirements and prerequisites 
* Concentration set
* Available Electives
* What will be learned and how it is applied in the field of study
* The career options available to a well-educated student
* Compensation expectations

## Project Division - Individual Contributions

### Pouya
* For the specific course Artificial Intelligence, and Robotics gather all the necessary information, and introduce some important Algorithm with animation and video, and how technology was involved by them. 

### Kirk
* Will build display framework.  Handle synchronization of data objects between input framework and output displays.  For the specific concentration Software Engineering and Application Development, gather the assets for building the module.

### Tulasi
* For the specific course Computer Networks and Security, Database and Systems, gather all the necessary information from 'what it is?' to career opportunities.
